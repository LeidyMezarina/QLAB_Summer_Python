b.	Information:  Data about real GDP, inflation, real consumption, real investment, reference interest rate, real salaries and real exchange rate on a monthly basis for the years between 2005 and 2019.

c.	Interest: I would like to study the effect that the monetary policy implemented by the central bank (through the reference or policy interest rate) had on various macroeconomic aggregates for the period 2005 - 2019. Likewise, I would like to identify the transmission channels that reveal the effects of said policy.

a.  Database: Statistical Information of Multiple Banking of the Superintendence of Banking, Insurance and AFP.

b. Information: Data about financial indicators, effective equity requirement and global capital ratio, active structure and passive structure on a annual basis for the years between 2009 and 2019.

3. Ruben-- ruben.rojasa@pucp.edu.pe

a.	Database: Credit risk, delinquency rates - Superintendency of Banking, Insurance, and Pension Fund Administrators (SBS)

b.	Information: Total Delinquency Rate, Consumer Delinquency Rate, Mortgage Delinquency Rate, Business Delinquency Rate, Total Portfolio Rating, Consumer Portfolio Rating

c.	Interest: I am interested in investigating the interplay between the monetary policy implemented by the central bank, as reflected in the reference or policy interest rate, and credit risk and delinquency rates. How variations in the policy interest rate may have influenced credit risk and delinquency rates as reported by the Superintendency of Banking, Insurance, and Pension Fund Administrators (SBS) in their dataset. Additionally, I intend to identify the transmission channels through which changes in the interest rate may manifest in credit-related metrics.
